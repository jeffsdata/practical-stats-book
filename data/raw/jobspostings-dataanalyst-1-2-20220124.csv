We're a small team of engineers, designers, and data scientists who are obsessed with building scalable products that customers love. Although we've worked for years as a remote team, we now work mostly from our New York City office and prefer candidates who would be able to show up in person at least once a week. We're backed by great organizations like Y Combinator, and know that a few smart, ambitious, and focused people can create outsized impact on the world. We're looking for such people to join us in creating next generation financial data infrastructure.
Who we're looking for
➣ You have 2+ years of experience in writing production-ready SQL (preferably PostgreSQL) code that processes large volumes of complex data (ex: transforming millions of rows of nested transaction data that has to be joined from multiple tables)
➣ You understand software engineering design principles and are passionate about writing sensible, performant, and elegant queries that can scale efficiently with little trouble
➣ You have experience using CRUD operations on SQL databases and writing ETL pipelines
➣ You take ownership of your work and carefully think through and document the code you write before you submit it for review. People should be able to understand your code without asking you, but if they do ask about any part of your code you should have clear and logical answers
➣ You understand that the customers and users come first, and always think about how the existing queries could be improved for them as well as potential new features for the app
➣ You work alongside all relevant members of the company and external stakeholders, not just engineering, to understand and resolve issues as well as orient yourself in the right direction
➣ You are constantly trying to improve yourself as an analyst (try new concepts/tools, active on data forums, etc.) and as a product builder (ask a lot of questions, read up on the industry, etc.)
Who we'd be excited by
➣ You have worked in the data industry before and are excited by technologies like ETL/data pipelines, data platforms, business intelligence/data visualization tools
➣ You have scaled infrastructure to process high volumes of data from other systems very quickly, and have experience working with pipeline/workflow tools (ETL services, DAGs, DBT)
➣ You are passionate about customer experience and have that same level empathy for our users, regardless of their technical skill
➣ You thrive in fast-paced environments and are able to evaluate several uncertain options logically to come up with the best possible decision at that time
What you'll be working on
➣ You will work closely with the Product team to create new queries and pipelines that the end users will use as templates, as well as come up with elegant improvements to existing templates
➣ As an early-stage startup, we as a team go through the whole product development lifecycle. You will be a part of brainstorming features, designing prototypes, developing and testing the product, and deploying code into production
➣ To accomplish our goals, we will need to help ourselves do our jobs. That means creating and maintaining documentation, improving queries over time, and even building our own tools
➣ There's a lot of infrastructure that needs to be built and improved over time, so you will be a part of the team that makes strategic, long-term technology and product decisions
➣ We are a small team and as a result, you'll be our first data engineer/analyst. That means you'll be a part of building our culture and workflows that future hires will be impacted by
What tools we use
➣ Languages and frameworks: PostgreSQL, dbt, MySQL
➣ Infrastructure: AWS
➣ Experience with these tools isn't a requirement, and we are always looking for tools that will make our lives easier and make building software feel delightful. Tell us your favorites!
